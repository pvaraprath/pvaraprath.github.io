        <p>Priya is originally from Michigan, currently lives in NYC and would like to live on every contintent except the coldest one for at least two years. She started out in the marketing advertising world then moved on to law before completely changing direction in life. Currently she is in the midst of exploring everything that interests her with the expectation that the dots will be connected at a later date. Officially she is an <em>entrepreneur first</em>, and on the side works as a data reconstruction specialist and airbnb host. The first thing she thinks about in the morning is coffee, and the last thing she thinks about at night is her pet project - <strong>Project Underdog</strong>.
