        <h1 id="AboutMe">who I am</h1>
        <p>I am Priya Varaprath. I am an entrepreneur living in Brooklyn who is a nomad at heart.</p>
        <p>The main thing on my mind is launching my pet project - <span style="color:#E15D44">Project Underdog</span>.</p>
        <p>I want to do good.</p>
        <p>I want to make 1,000 origami cranes</p>
        <p>The first thing I think about in the morning is coffee.</p>
        <p>I have the soul of a nomad but have settled in Brooklyn for the time being.</p>
        <p>I dream about living on every contintent except the coldest one for at least two years.
        <p>I have a desire learn French but feel that I should first have fluency in my native tongue of Malayalam.</p>

        <h2>So what is <span style="color:#E15D44">Project Underdog</span>?</h2>
        <p><span style="color:#E15D44">Project Underdog's</span> mission is to help the 6-8 million animals that enter the American shelter system every year. How? Well, by turning poop into good of course!</p>
        <p>More than 60 million dogs poop everyday in the US alone. If 60 million dogs poop just once a day, that means they generate at least 21.9 billion poop piles a year. Now, imagine the possible impact if even 1% of dog poop piles contributed 1 cent to animal organizations that care for and protect the 6-8 million neglected, abandoned and abused underdogs that enter the shelter system every year. We imagined, and we found it would equal 2.19 million dollars.</p>
        <p>Dog poop has to be picked up daily because it poses health hazards such as e-coli contamination. This makes products to pick up dog poop a necessity. Of these, poop bags are the most commonly used. Since dogs will not stop pooping anytime soon, poop bags represent the perfect foundation for a sustainable stream of funding to help the millions of underdogs in need. Thatâ€™s why we established Project Underdog, a social for profit that sells poopbags. A portion of each sale will be donated to animal organizations fighting for underdogs. Sign up to our mailing list so you can buy Project Underdog poopbags and help animals lead happier lives!</p>
